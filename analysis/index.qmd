# Introduction

In the 2024 presidential election, Philadelphia was expected to be a crucial battleground for votes in Pennsylvania, and thus potentially to be pivotal for the outcome of the race as a whole. However, the number of votes cast in Philadelphia declined from the last presidential election in 2020, from 749,317 in the earlier year to 727,595. The turnout rate, which is the ratio of votes cast to registered voters, was also lower in 2024 (65.10%) compared to 2020 (66.35%).

What explains the lower turnout? In this analysis, we look at how several different electoral and demographic factors may have influenced turnout changes between 2024 and 2020.
