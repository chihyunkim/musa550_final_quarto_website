From the Philadelphia City Commissioners website, I obtained precinct-level turnout and results from the 2024 and 2020 elections. From these data, I calculated the turnout rate as well as the Democratic share of the 2-party presidential vote, in both years. Demographic data at the census tract level was obtained from the American Community Survey (2023, 5-year), and joined to the precinct-level data based on the centroid of the precinct, calculated from shapefiles made available by the City of Philadelphia. (Because precinct boundaries do not nest with tract boundaries, the match is not exact, but generally tracts are significantly larger in size then precincts.)\n\n# Read prepared data\ninput_data = gpd.read_file('data/prepared_data.geojson')  \n\n\nFirst look\nThe interactive map below shows the turnout rate at each precinct in the 2024 election. Turnout varies grographically across the city, with precincts in Northwest Philadelphia and Northeast Philadelphia more likely to have higher turnout and precints in North and West Philadelphia more likely to have lower turnout.\n\n# Plot map of turnout\ninput_data.explore(column='turnout_2024', \n                   tiles=\"CartoDB positron\", \n                   tooltip = ['precinct', 'turnout_2024', 'turnout_2020', 'turnout_change'], \n                   style_kwds = {'opacity' : 0})\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nThe histogram below shows the distibution of our measure of interest, turnout change. Far more precincts experienced declines in turnout than increases.\n\nalt.Chart(input_data, title='Histogram of turnout change between 2020 and 2024').mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X(\"turnout_change\", bin=True).title('Turnout change'),\n    alt.Y('count()').title('Count of precincts')\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can also be seen in the map below, showing that turnout was depressed across much of the city compared to 2020, except for a few locations, especially around the universities in West and North Philadelphia.\n\n# Plot map of turnout change\ninput_data.explore(column='turnout_change', \n                   tiles=\"CartoDB positron\", \n                   cmap = 'PiYG', \n                   tooltip = ['precinct', 'turnout_change', 'turnout_2024', 'turnout_2020'], \n                   style_kwds = {'opacity' : 0})\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\n\n\nA deeper look\nWe can examine more closely the other politico-demographic variables in our data. One possibility is that shifts in turnout are correlated with shifts in political leanings, given the overall Republican shift of the electorate in 2024 compared to 2020.\nBelow, an interactive scatterplot comparing turnout in 2024 vs 2020 is presented side-by-side with a histogram of turnout change by partisan shift.\n\n# Create extra column for partisan changes between 2020 and 2024\ninput_data['party_shift_2024'] = np.where(input_data['pres_d_share_change'] &gt; 0, 'Moved D', 'Moved R')\n\n\nselector = alt.selection_point(fields=['party_shift_2024'])\n\ncolor_scale = alt.Scale(domain=['Moved D', 'Moved R'],\n                        range=['#475bf5', '#d13532'])\n\nbase = alt.Chart(input_data).properties(\n    width=250,\n    height=250\n).add_params(selector)\n\npoints = base.mark_point(filled=True, size=200).encode(\n    x=alt.X('turnout_2020:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[0,1])),\n    y=alt.Y('turnout_2024:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[0,1])),\n    color=alt.condition(selector,\n                        'party_shift_2024:N',\n                        alt.value('lightgray'),\n                        scale=color_scale),\n    tooltip=['precinct', 'turnout_change', 'pres_d_share_change']\n)\n\nhists = base.mark_bar(opacity=0.5, thickness=100).encode(\n    x=alt.X('turnout_change',\n            bin=alt.Bin(step=0.05), # step keeps bin size the same\n            scale=alt.Scale(domain=[-0.3,0.3])\n            ).title('Turnout change'),\n    y=alt.Y('count()',\n            stack=None,\n            scale=alt.Scale(domain=[0,1200])\n            ).title('Count of precincts'),\n    color=alt.Color('party_shift_2024:N',\n                    scale=color_scale)\n).transform_filter(\n    selector\n)\n\n\npoints | hists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the histogram, it is clear that far more precincts experienced a shift toward the Republican candidate than toward the Democratic candidate, at least relative to the histocial majority-Democratic electorate in Philadelphia.\nHowever, the shift in turnout does not seem to be substantially skewed by partisan shift, except for a few R-shifted precincts in the 27th and 24th wards (the points above the diagonal in the scatterplot), which are adjacent to Drexel and University of Pennsylvania.\nThe following interactive scatterplot allows you to choose between many explanatory variables on the x-axis. A clear relationship between these variables and turnout change is not readily descernible, except for the jump in turnout in the precincts with a high percentage of residents who are university students. This effect is also secondarily noticeable in other variables such as median income and rentership.\n\ndropdown = alt.binding_select(\n    options=['turnout_2020', 'pres_d_share_2024', 'pres_d_share_2020', 'pres_d_share_change', \n             'demographics_median_income', 'demographics_black_percentage', 'demographics_latino_percentage', \n             'demographics_renter_percentage', 'demographics_university_percentage'],\n    name='X-axis column '\n)\n\nxcol_param = alt.param(\n    value='turnout_2020',\n    bind=dropdown\n)\n\nbase = alt.Chart(input_data, title='Correlations between turnout change and selected variable').properties(\n    width=400,\n    height=400\n).add_params(xcol_param)\n\ninteractive_scatter = base.mark_point(filled=True, size=15).encode(\n    x=alt.X('x:Q', title=''),\n    y=alt.Y('turnout_change:Q'),\n    tooltip=['precinct', 'turnout_change', 'x:Q']\n).transform_calculate(\n    x=f'datum[{xcol_param.name}]'\n)\n\ninteractive_scatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn sum, there is a clear effect of increased turnout in student-deavy precincts, very likely driven by the pandemic-specific effects in 2020, when many university students were not in residence at school.",
