From the Philadelphia City Commissioners website, I obtained precinct-level turnout and results from the 2024 and 2020 elections. From these data, I calculated the turnout rate as well as the Democratic share of the 2-party presidential vote, in both years. Demographic data at the census tract level was obtained from the American Community Survey (2023, 5-year), and joined to the precinct-level data based on the centroid of the precinct. (Because precinct boundaries do not nest with tract boundaries, the match is not exact, but generally tracts are significantly larger in size then precincts.)\n\n# Read prepared data\ninput_data = gpd.read_file('data/prepared_data.geojson')  \n\n\nFirst look\nThe interactive map below shows the turnout rate at each precinct in the 2024 election. Turnout varies grographically across the city, with precincts in Northwest Philadelphia and Northeast Philadelphia more likely to have higher turnout and precints in North and West Philadelphia more likely to have lower turnout.\n\n# Plot map of turnout\ninput_data.explore(column='turnout_2024', \n                   tiles=\"CartoDB positron\", \n                   tooltip = ['precinct', 'turnout_2024', 'turnout_2020', 'turnout_change'], \n                   style_kwds = {'opacity' : 0})\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nThe histogram below shows the distibution of our measure of interest, turnout change. Far more precincts experienced declines in turnout than increases.\n\nalt.Chart(input_data, title='Histogram of turnout change between 2020 and 2024').mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X(\"turnout_change\", bin=True).title('Turnout change'),\n    alt.Y('count()').title('Count of precincts')\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can also be seen in the map below, showing that turnout was depressed across much of the city compared to 2020, except for a few locations, especially around the universities in West and North Philadelphia.\n\n# Plot map of turnout change\ninput_data.explore(column='turnout_change', \n                   tiles=\"CartoDB positron\", \n                   cmap = 'PiYG', \n                   tooltip = ['precinct', 'turnout_change', 'turnout_2024', 'turnout_2020'], \n                   style_kwds = {'opacity' : 0})\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook",
