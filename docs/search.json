From the Philadelphia City Commissioners website, I obtained precinct-level turnout and results from the 2024 and 2020 elections. From these data, I calculated the turnout rate as well as the Democratic share of the 2-party presidential vote, in both years. Demographic data at the census tract level was obtained from the American Community Survey (2023, 5-year), and joined to the precinct-level data based on the centroid of the precinct, calculated from shapefiles made available by the City of Philadelphia. (Because precinct boundaries do not nest with tract boundaries, the match is not exact, but generally tracts are significantly larger in size then precincts.)\n\n# Read prepared data\ninput_data = gpd.read_file('data/prepared_data.geojson')",
